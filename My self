Hello everyone,

I'm Ceciliya Sahyam, and I'm delighted to have the opportunity to introduce myself to you.

I recently completed my B.ComCA degree, where I gained a strong foundation in accounting and computer applications. While pursuing my degree, I discovered my passion for technology and decided to dive deeper into the world of web development.

Currently, I'm enrolled in a web development course where I'm learning various programming languages and frameworks to build modern and responsive websites. I'm excited about honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web development technologies to create dynamic and user-friendly web applications.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring new technologies, participating in coding challenges, and continuously expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of web development.

I'm eager to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on exciting projects, and contribute to the vibrant tech community.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I look forward to engaging with each of you and sharing our passion for technology.

Best regards,
Ceciliya Sahyam
